<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Pizza (Italian: [pittsa], Neapolitan: [pitts…ô]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, 
flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients 
(such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), 
which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. 
A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. 
In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p>
